# Workflow State & Rules (STM + Rules + Log)

_This file contains the dynamic state, embedded rules, active plan, and log for the current session._
_It is read and updated frequently by the AI during its operational loop._

---

## State

_Holds the current status of the workflow._

```yaml
Phase: CONSTRUCT # Current workflow phase (ANALYZE, BLUEPRINT, CONSTRUCT, VALIDATE, BLUEPRINT_REVISE)
Status: READY # Current status (READY, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED_*, NEEDS_*, COMPLETED, COMPLETED_ITERATION)
CurrentTaskID: PlanLandingPageSections # Identifier for the main task being worked on
CurrentStep: 10 # Identifier for the specific step in the plan being executed
CurrentItem: null # Identifier for the item currently being processed in iteration
```

---

## Plan

_Contains the step-by-step implementation plan generated by AI during the BLUEPRINT phase._
**Task: SummarizeItemsIteratively**

---

## Rules

_Embedded rules governing the AI's autonomous operation._
**# --- Core Workflow Rules ---**
RULE*WF_PHASE_ANALYZE:
**Constraint:** Goal is understanding request/context. NO solutioning or implementation planning.
RULE_WF_PHASE_BLUEPRINT:
**Constraint:** Goal is creating a detailed, unambiguous step-by-step plan. NO code implementation.
RULE_WF_PHASE_CONSTRUCT:
**Constraint:** Goal is executing the `## Plan` exactly. NO deviation. If issues arise, trigger error handling or revert phase.
RULE_WF_PHASE_VALIDATE:
**Constraint:** Goal is verifying implementation against `## Plan` and requirements using tools. NO new implementation.
RULE_WF_TRANSITION_01:
**Trigger:** Explicit user command (`@analyze`, `@blueprint`, `@construct`, `@validate`).
**Action:** Update `State.Phase` accordingly. Log phase change.
RULE_WF_TRANSITION_02:
**Trigger:** AI determines current phase constraint prevents fulfilling user request OR error handling dictates phase change (e.g., RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01).
**Action:** Log the reason. Update `State.Phase` (e.g., to `BLUEPRINT_REVISE`). Set `State.Status` appropriately (e.g., `NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL`). Report to user.
RULE_ITERATE_01: # Triggered by RULE_MEM_READ_STM_01 when State.Status == READY and State.CurrentItem == null, or after VALIDATE phase completion.
**Trigger:** `State.Status == READY` and `State.CurrentItem == null` OR after `VALIDATE` phase completion.
**Action:** 1. Check `## Items` section for more items. 2. If more items: 3. Set `State.CurrentItem` to the next item. 4. Clear `## Log`. 5. Set `State.Phase = ANALYZE`, `State.Status = READY`. 6. Log "Starting processing item [State.CurrentItem]". 7. If no more items: 8. Trigger `RULE_ITERATE_02`.
RULE_ITERATE_02:
**Trigger:** `RULE_ITERATE_01` determines no more items.
**Action:** 1. Set `State.Status = COMPLETED_ITERATION`. 2. Log "Tokenization iteration completed."
**# --- Initialization & Resumption Rules ---**
RULE_INIT_01:
**Trigger:** AI session/task starts AND `workflow_state.md` is missing or empty.
**Action:** 1. Create `workflow_state.md` with default structure. 2. Read `project_config.md` (prompt user if missing). 3. Set `State.Phase = ANALYZE`, `State.Status = READY`. 4. Log "Initialized new session." 5. Prompt user for the first task.
RULE_INIT_02:
**Trigger:** AI session/task starts AND `workflow_state.md` exists.
**Action:** 1. Read `project_config.md`. 2. Read existing `workflow_state.md`. 3. Log "Resumed session." 4. Check `State.Status`: Handle READY, COMPLETED, BLOCKED*_, NEEDS\__, IN_PROGRESS appropriately (prompt user or report status).
RULE_INIT_03:
**Trigger:** User confirms continuation via RULE_INIT_02 (for IN_PROGRESS state).
**Action:** Proceed with the next action based on loaded state and rules.
**# --- Memory Management Rules ---**
RULE_MEM_READ_LTM_01:
**Trigger:** Start of a new major task or phase.
**Action:** Read `project_config.md`. Log action.
RULE_MEM_READ_STM_01:
**Trigger:** Before _every_ decision/action cycle.
**Action:** 1. Read `workflow_state.md`. 2. If `State.Status == READY` and `State.CurrentItem == null`: 3. Log "Attempting to trigger RULE_ITERATE_01". 4. Trigger `RULE_ITERATE_01`.
RULE_MEM_UPDATE_STM_01:
**Trigger:** After _every_ significant action or information receipt.
**Action:** Immediately update relevant sections (`## State`, `## Plan`, `## Log`) in `workflow_state.md` and save.
RULE_MEM_UPDATE_LTM_01:
**Trigger:** User command (`@config/update`) OR end of successful VALIDATE phase for significant change.
**Action:** Propose concise updates to `project_config.md` based on `## Log`/diffs. Set `State.Status = NEEDS_LTM_APPROVAL`. Await user confirmation.
RULE_MEM_VALIDATE_01:
**Trigger:** After updating `workflow_state.md` or `project_config.md`.
**Action:** Perform internal consistency check. If issues found, log and set `State.Status = NEEDS_CLARIFICATION`.
**# --- Tool Integration Rules (Cursor Environment) ---**
RULE_TOOL_LINT_01:
**Trigger:** Relevant source file saved during CONSTRUCT phase.
**Action:** Instruct Cursor terminal to run lint command. Log attempt. On completion, parse output, log result, set `State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT` if errors.
RULE_TOOL_FORMAT_01:
**Trigger:** Relevant source file saved during CONSTRUCT phase.
**Action:** Instruct Cursor to apply formatter or run format command via terminal. Log attempt.
RULE_TOOL_TEST_RUN_01:
**Trigger:** Command `@validate` or entering VALIDATE phase.
**Action:** Instruct Cursor terminal to run test suite. Log attempt. On completion, parse output, log result, set `State.Status = BLOCKED_TEST` if failures, `TESTS_PASSED` if success.
RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01:
**Trigger:** AI determines code change needed per `## Plan` during CONSTRUCT phase.
RULE_PROCESS_ITEM_01:
**Trigger:** `State.Phase == CONSTRUCT` and `State.CurrentItem` is not null and current step in `## Plan` requires item processing.
**Action:** 1. **Get Item Text:** Based on `State.CurrentItem`, extract the corresponding 'Text to Tokenize' from the `## Items` section. 2. **Summarize (Placeholder):** Use a placeholder to generate a summary of the extracted text. For example, "Summary of [text] is [placeholder summary]". 3. **Estimate Token Count:**
a. Read `Characters Per Token (Estimate)` from `project_config.md`.
b. Get the text content of the item from the `## Items` section. (Placeholder: Implement logic to extract text based on `State.CurrentItem` from the `## Items` table.)
c. Calculate `estimated_tokens = length(text_content) / 4`. 4. **Summarize (Placeholder):** Use a placeholder to generate a summary of the extracted text. For example, "Summary of [text] is [placeholder summary]". (Placeholder: Replace with actual summarization tool/logic) 5. **Store Results:** Append a new row to the `## TokenizationResults` table with:
_ `Item ID`: `State.CurrentItem`
_ `Summary`: The generated summary. (Placeholder: Implement logic to store the summary.) \* `Token Count`: `estimated_tokens`. 6. Log the processing actions, results, and estimated token count to the `## Log`. (Placeholder: Implement logging.)
**Action:** Generate modification. Instruct Cursor to apply it. Log action.
**# --- Error Handling & Recovery Rules ---**
RULE_ERR_HANDLE_LINT_01:
**Trigger:** `State.Status` is `BLOCKED_LINT`.
**Action:** Analyze error in `## Log`. Attempt auto-fix if simple/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run lint via RULE_TOOL_LINT_01. If success, reset `State.Status`. If fail/complex, set `State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT_UNRESOLVED`, report to user.
RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01:
**Trigger:** `State.Status` is `BLOCKED_TEST`.
**Action:** Analyze failure in `## Log`. Attempt auto-fix if simple/localized/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run failed test(s) or suite via RULE_TOOL_TEST_RUN_01. If success, reset `State.Status`. If fail/complex, set `State.Phase = BLUEPRINT_REVISE`, `State.Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL`, propose revised `## Plan` based on failure analysis, report to user.
RULE_ERR_HANDLE_GENERAL_01:
**Trigger:** Unexpected error or ambiguity.
**Action:** Log error/situation to `## Log`. Set `State.Status = BLOCKED_UNKNOWN`. Report to user, request instructions.
